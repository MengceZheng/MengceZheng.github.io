## üë®‚Äçüíº About Me

I am currently an Associate Professor at [Zhejiang Wanli University (ZWU)](https://www.zwu.edu.cn/) and work as the head of the Cyber Security major.
Before joining ZWU, I worked as a postdoctoral researcher at [School of Information Science and Technology](https://sist.ustc.edu.cn/main.htm) of [University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)](https://www.ustc.edu.cn/) from 2018.12 to 2020.12 under collaboration with Prof. [Nenghai Yu (‰øûËÉΩÊµ∑)](https://faculty.ustc.edu.cn/yunenghai/zh_CN/index.htm) and Prof. [Honggang Hu (ËÉ°Á∫¢Èí¢)](https://faculty.ustc.edu.cn/huhonggang/zh_CN/index.htm).

From 2009.09 to 2018.11, I studied at USTC, where I received my bachelor's degree in 2013 and the doctoral degree in 2018, advised by Prof. Honggang Hu.
I conducted academic visits at [The University of Tokyo (UTokyo)](https://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/) from 2016.10 to 2017.09 under collaboration with Prof. [Noboru Kunihiro](https://www.crisec.cs.tsukuba.ac.jp/kunihiro/english/). I conducted academic visits at [University of Caen Normandy (UniCaen)](https://www.unicaen.fr/) from 2024.11 to 2025.10 under collaboration with Prof. [Abderrahmane Nitaj](https://nitaj.users.lmno.cnrs.fr/).

My main research interests include cryptographic algorithms and their applications, including public-key cryptanalysis, side-channel analysis, quantum cryptographic protocols, etc.
I have published more than 30 papers [![Google Scholar Citations](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?logo=Google%20Scholar&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.jsdelivr.net%2Fgh%2FMengceZheng%2FMengceZheng.github.io@google-scholar-stats%2Fgs_data_shieldsio.json&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations)](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=WgoBZnkAAAAJ), in related journals and conferences such as SCIENCE CHINA Information Sciences, Theoretical Computer Science, Journal of Information Security and Applications, CHES, ACISP, etc.

## üß∞ Projects

- Lattice-Based Cryptanalysis: It employs lattice structures to analyze cryptographic systems. The celebrated Coppersmith's method utilizes lattice reduction to find small roots of polynomial equations modulo an integer. This technique can compromise RSA cryptosystem, especially with short exponents or partial key exposure, by efficiently recovering messages or factorizing the RSA modulus. This highlights the need for careful parameter selection in cryptographic protocols to prevent such vulnerabilities.

- Post-Quantum Cryptography: It develops cryptographic methods secure against quantum computer attacks. Lattice-based cryptography, a key area within this field, relies on mathematical structures called lattices. Its security is based on the difficulty of solving certain lattice problems, making it resistant to both classical and quantum attacks. This approach is efficient, scalable, and forms the basis for various cryptographic protocols, including key exchanges and digital signatures.

- Quantum Network Protocols: It uses quantum mechanics to create secure communication channels. A key component is quantum key distribution (QKD), which allows two parties to generate a shared secret key for encrypting messages. QKD detects eavesdropping attempts due to quantum properties, offering security beyond classical methods. This is crucial in post-quantum cryptography, as it also protects information against future quantum computer threats.

- Side-Channel Analysis: It extracts sensitive information from cryptographic systems by monitoring unintended emissions like power consumption or timing variations. Machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) have recently enhanced such attacks by automatically identifying complex patterns in side-channel data, enabling more accurate and efficient recovery of secret keys. This advancement underscores the need for robust countermeasures in the cryptographic implementations.

## üë®‚Äçüíº About Me

I am currently an Associate Professor at [Zhejiang Wanli University (ZWU)](https://www.zwu.edu.cn/) and work as the head of the Cyber Security major.
Before joining ZWU, I worked as a postdoctoral researcher at [School of Information Science and Technology](https://sist.ustc.edu.cn/main.htm) of [University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)](https://www.ustc.edu.cn/) from 2018.12 to 2020.12 under collaboration with Prof. [Nenghai Yu (‰øûËÉΩÊµ∑)](https://faculty.ustc.edu.cn/yunenghai/zh_CN/index.htm) and Prof. [Honggang Hu (ËÉ°Á∫¢Èí¢)](https://faculty.ustc.edu.cn/huhonggang/zh_CN/index.htm).

From 2009.09 to 2018.11, I studied at USTC, where I received my bachelor's degree in 2013 and the doctoral degree in 2018, advised by Prof. Honggang Hu.
I conducted academic visits at [The University of Tokyo (UTokyo)](https://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/) from 2016.10 to 2017.09 under collaboration with Prof. [Noboru Kunihiro](https://www.crisec.cs.tsukuba.ac.jp/kunihiro/english/).  

My main research interests include cryptographic algorithms and their applications, including public-key cryptanalysis, side-channel analysis, quantum cryptographic protocols, etc.
I have published more than 30 papers <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=WgoBZnkAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?logo=Google%20Scholar&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.jsdelivr.net%2Fgh%2FMengceZheng%2FMengceZheng.github.io@google-scholar-stats%2Fgs_data_shieldsio.json&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>, in related journals and conferences such as SCIENCE CHINA Information Sciences, Theoretical Computer Science, Journal of Information Security and Applications, CHES, ACISP, etc.

Further information on my experience and work can be found in my attached [**CV**](/assets/files/CV.pdf).
